### Build a simple webapp using reactjs and breaking bad api 

- Create a new react project (either locally or on codesandbox)
- Create reusable card component
- Use fetch to call breaking bad api (url - https://www.breakingbadapi.com/api/characters)
- Store the response in state
- Map that response to the Card component
- Push it if you've developed it locally, deploy to netlify, and share link
- If you have developed on codesandbox then share the link
